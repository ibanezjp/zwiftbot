# ZwiftBot

www.zwift.com is a virtual cycling platform. ZwiftBot is a Telegram Bot (@TheZwiftMasterBot) that helps me and my friends to find common uncompleated routes making meetup creation easier.

This bot is hosted in Azure, using Azure Bot Services and it consumes my ZwiftAPI https://github.com/ibanezjp/zwiftapi and it was created for fun and learing and with love for sports.
